                                               ############# DOM ############ 


Every web page resides inside a browser window which can be considered as an object.When the web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of document content. The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the "Document Object Model", or "DOM". 

 		The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

   				

   				                ####### What is the HTML DOM? #######

"The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML". It is constructed as a tree of Objects. It defines:

*The HTML elements as objects
*The properties of all HTML elements
*The methods to access all HTML elements
*The events for all HTML elements

Here, HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements) and HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
Therefore in other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

			          

			                    ####### The DOM Programming Interface ########

The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages). In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

* A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

* A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).
