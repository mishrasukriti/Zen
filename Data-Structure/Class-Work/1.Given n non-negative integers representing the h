1.Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram 

2. We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.  

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.  
A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.  Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.
