1. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
Attempting to read null or undefined as if it was an object. For example:

var someVal = null;
console.log(someVal.foo);

----> How to fix it?
Usually caused by typos. Check that the variables used near the line number pointed by the error are correctly named.

2. Undefined/null is not an Object:
Trying to access an undefined or null object.

----> How to fix it?
Debug and check that all referred objects and nested objects exist for each of the elements. There is probably a nested object down the chain that does not exist for at least one of the elements.

3. Unknown Script error:
"Script Error" happens when an uncaught JavaScript error crosses domain boundaries in violation of the cross-origin policy. 
-----> How to fix it?
Set Up a Cross-Origin HTTP Header or Set Crossorigin = "anonymous"

5. TypeError: object does not support property
----> How to fix it?
Analyze the code in the file where the error occurred and come up with a hypothesis for the reason.
Get the logic of the proposed fix validated by an Oppia team member (have this discussion on the issue thread).
Make a PR that fixes the issue, then close the issue on merging the PR. 

6.TypeError: undefined is not a function

Occurs when attempting to call a value like a function, where the value is not a function. For example:

var foo = undefined;
foo();

This error typically occurs if you are trying to call a function in an object, but you typed the name wrong.

---- How to fix it? 
Ensure the function name is correct. With this error, the line number will usually point at the correct location.

7. RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
Usually caused by a bug in program logic, causing infinite recursive function calls.
---- How to fix it? 
Check recursive functions for bugs that could cause them to keep recursing forever.


8. Typeerror cannot read property ‘length’
usually occurs when you define a normal variable instead of array variable
---- How to fix it? 
To solve this issue define a normal variable as ‘Array’([]) variable.The correct code snippet is shown below

9. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property
Attempting to write null or undefined as if it was an object. For example:

---> How to fix this error?
This too is usually caused by typos. Check the variable names near the line the error points to.

10. ReferenceError: event is not defined error in Firefox

declaring (some of) your event handlers incorrectly:

---> How to fix this error?
You need "event" to be a parameter to the handlers. WebKit follows IE's old behavior of using a global symbol for "event", but Firefox doesn't. When you're using jQuery, that library normalizes the behavior and ensures that your event handlers are passed the event parameter.


2. Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment

Caused by attempting to assign a value to something that cannot be assigned to.
The most common example of this error is with if-clauses:

if(doSomething() = 'somevalue')

How to fix it?: Make sure you’re not attempting to assign values to function results or to the this keyword.
