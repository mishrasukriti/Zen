################# Difference between Window, Screen and Document object ##########
To describe briefly:
1. Window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript
2. Document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML
3. Screen describes the physical display's full screen

######## Window ###########
The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window. A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.

The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser . This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
The window object represents the current browsing context . It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document . Each browser tab has its own top-level window object.

######## Document ######## 
The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.

######## Screen ######## 
Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix.


###### Relation between Document and Window object 

When JavaScript is executed inside the browser, the window object is the JavaScript Global object. The document object is a property of the window object.

The window object represents the browser window.
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.
